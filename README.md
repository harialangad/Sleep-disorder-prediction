# Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict sleep disorders based on relevant features. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach to building, training, and evaluating a predictive model.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Apply appropriate feature engineering.
- Train machine learning models to predict sleep disorders.
- Evaluate the models' performance using standard metrics.

## Workflow

The notebook covers:
1. **Data Loading**
   - Import and explore the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize or scale the data if required.
   - Encode categorical features.

3. **Model Training**
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or any suitable model).
   - Tune hyperparameters as needed.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
